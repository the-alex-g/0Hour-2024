# 0Hour-2024

I made this game in one hour, from 2:00 AM to 2:00 AM, Nov 3, 2024.

At least, all the programming and the one piece of art was done in that time slot. Afterward, I got the web deployment to work. I also made the game resize properly.

Use A and D to move left and right, Space to jump, IJKL to attack, or SHIFT + IJKL to defend.
